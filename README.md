# hello-world
My first repository with the github guide

I work as a technician for Need A Nerd Waikato, part of a nationwide francise of I.T. tecnicians specialising in the small business and residential market.  Most of what I do is problem solving, installing solutions, new hardware, software etc. or simly maintaining existing systems.
From time to time I like to work with code and learn to do more with linux and open-source software.
I also like singing, photography and cycling trails in New Zealand!
